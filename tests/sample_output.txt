Begin with a spin down state:
|0>
Applying Hadamard gate rotates the state pi about the (x+z)/sqrt(2) axis.
0.707|0> + 0.707|1>
Applying Pauli-X gate rotates π about the X-axis. This is a quantum NOT gate.
|1>
Applying Pauli-Y gate rotates π about the Y-axis.
i|1>
Applying Pauli-Z gate rotates π about the Z-axis. This is a phaseshift for θ = π.
